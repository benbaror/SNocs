snocs
=====

Snocs is a little wrapper on SCons Software Construction tool

If you found SCons too low level then Snocs will help you to rise the level of abstraction for the C/C++ development

1. Snocs builds any project from your Projects directory even if your current directory somewhere else now.
2. You can set dependencies in project's SConscript and snocs will automatically call dependent SConscripts.
3. Snocs helps you with choosing of compiler, platform and configuration for your current build.
4. Enables you to setup Unit tests for your project.
